# G_code-Sender
Final Year Project: Smart PCB Fabrication Machine 
University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila.

Applcation sends any contents of readable txt files through serial communication which can be recieved by any microcontroller outthere. In this case we were sending contents to an arduino uno. Application was developed in Visual Studio C#. We used the application to send g codes to our cnc machine to start its drilling process on copper that is placed. The gcodes can be generated after exporting gerbers files from the EDA tool you're using to make PCB designs.
